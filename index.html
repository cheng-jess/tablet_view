          Even though diamonds are Botswana’s largest export, its true jewel is the wildlife in it. All the big five game animals are present in the Okavango Delta. It also holds one of the world’s largest animal populations, including elephants, lions, cheetahs, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Okavango Delta is in the middle of a desert, making it one of the few deltas that stand out from the other ~10000 deltas. Oil deposits were recently discovered in the rock in the Delta. This is a possible threat as extraction companies may pollute the water bodies, risking the lives of over 500 species of animals.

          Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore, America’s first National Lakeshore, is along the southern shore of Lake Superior in Michigan’s beautiful Upper Peninsula. With stunning beaches, 10 inland lakes, and nearly 100 miles of trails, everyone can find something to enjoy at Pictured Rocks! (source: https://www.nps.gov/piro/planyourvisit/index.htm)
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter the time of year, there is something to do at Pictured Rocks! Summer: visit beaches, backpack, and camp (permit required). Looking for views of the cliffs? The best way to see the cliffs is from the water on a commercial boat tour. Fall: Autumn colors in the Upper Peninsula are often breathtaking, drive the park roads to view the changing leaves! Hunting and fishing opportunities (state regulations apply) abound during fall! Winter: Cold weather brings otherworldly frozen waterfalls, called “curtains”. Snowshoeing, skiing, and ice fishing are other popular winter activities. Check road closures and conditions before heading into the park in the winter. Spring: Go birding or walk the marsh trail!
